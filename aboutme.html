  <p>I am a Mexican-American journalist who is passionate about everything that I do. I am a curious individual who explores life through experiences.</p>
  <p> I am originally from Chicago where I was born and raised. Growing up in Chicago allowed to experience and grow culturally aware of everyone's different background because it is a city that is considered a melting-pot of many different people. That allowed to have an undertsanding of evryones point of view and it made me value how furtunate I was with even having so little.</p>
  <p> I am now based in Miami where I earned my bachelors degree in broadast journalism and minor in public relations. I chose broadcast journalism because I wanted to be the voice for people that don't have the platform to share their stories. Attending the University, I discovered my love for public relations.</p>
  <p> In the future, I see myself owning my own business. I will be an entrepeneur in the industry that I love, the beauty industry. I plan to brand myself througout my career to launch a very succesful business and become a succesful public figure.</p>
